# AR Plane Tracking and Interactivity

For my final project in CS8395-01, I will be using this youtube video as my motivation.

This models an AR Drone that flies from one location to another, based on where the tracker is positioned on the screen.
For my project, I will be simulating something to this with a plane. The plane object will fly from one tracked position to the next,
based on a simple tracker that I will be uploading myself. To expand on the original idea, this project will also incorporate 
interactivity functions, such as button clicks to change the state of the plane. This idea stems from the previous project we 
completed, where we used an AR book cover with buttons to show different information about the book. I will create a button attached
to the tracker that will allow you to change plane models and the look of the object.

This project will be done in Unity using Vuforia on my MacBook Pro computer. I will also attempt to connect this to my iPhone camera for
better video quality and use.
